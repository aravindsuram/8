Coding is an integral part of any programming job interviews Java development interviews are no exception. I would even suggest you should never hire anyone without testing their coding skill, coding is also an art and more often than a good code is a good developer as well. If you look at tech giants like Amazon, Facebook, and Google they thoroughly test the coding skill of any developer they hire, particularly Amazon who first send online coding exercises to filter Java programmers who can code. This online test usually gives you requirements and ask you write a program in limited time usually 2 to 3 hours. The program should meet the output given by the exercise itself. These type of exercises are very tough to crack if you don't have a good coding skill.

Btw, the most important question is how do you develop that kind of coding skill in the first place? Well, things always start small and if you pay attention, there are many Java Job interviews where you would have been asked to write small programs.

They are simple but yet they give a good indication of coding skill of perspective candidates. They are usually preferred by many companies because it usually requires 10 to 20 minutes to write the solution and discuss them.

In this list, I am going to share 50 of such small programs from Java Programming interviews. These programs are from various Data Structure and Algorithm topics e.g. array, string, linked list, binary tree etc. If you don't have a good knowledge of Data structure and algorithm, I suggest you to first read a good book on Data Structure and Algorithms e.g. Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen. If you find that book difficult, you can get more options in my post about algorithm books here.
